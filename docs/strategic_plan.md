# Strategic Plan for a Production-Grade CLV Engine 
Audience: Finance, Marketing, Sales, Product, Customer Success Stakeholders  
Focus: Using Transactional Data to Predict and Act on Customer Lifetime Value

---

## 1. Goal

To build a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction engine that allows the business to:

- Prioritize customers by future value
- Improve campaign efficiency and personalization
- Support forecasting and budgeting with future revenue insights
- Enable smarter product and Customer Success strategy via lifecycle understanding

This system predicts how much a customer is likely to spend over the next 3 to 12 months.

---

## 2. Scope

### Included:
- Predict CLV in dollars using customer_id, order_date, revenue
- Unified model with lifecycle-aware features (tenure, recency, customer_stage, etc.)
- Tracking customer behavior over time
- Segment-based explainability and insights
- Exploratory behavioral clustering
- Batch scoring of customers for campaign use
- CSVs for business use and dashboards

### Not Included in V1:
- Real-time scoring APIs
- Profit-based LTV (with cost/margin)
- Product-level or channel-specific modeling
- Integration with CRM or email platforms(handled downstream)
- Automated routing based on clusters (planned for later phases)

---

## 3. Business Value

| Department | Use Case | Value |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Marketing | Identify VIPs, improve targeting, optimize reactivation | Higher ROI, lower CAC |
| Sales | Rank leads/accounts by value | Focused conversion |
| Product | Adjust UX based on lifecycle | Improved activation, retention |
| Finance | Predict future cohort revenue | More accurate forecasting |
| Customer Success | Route by CLV value | Improved loyalty and satisfaction |

---

## 4. Strategic Solution Design

### 4.1 Features Engineered 

| Feature | What It Captures |
|---------|------------------|
| revenue_sum | Customer’s total value |
| avg_order_value | Typical transaction size |
| log_revenue_sum | Smoothed version for outlier control |
| recency_days | Time since last order |
| tenure_days | Time since first order |
| is_repeat_buyer | flag 1 if customer bought more than once |
| active_last_30d | flag 1 if customer bought in last 30 days |
| customer_stage | Categorical bin of tenure: New, Growing, Established, Loyal |  
| mean_days_between_orders | Average time between purchases |
| median_days_between_orders | Typical wait time between purchases |
| std_days_between_orders | Consistency or irregularity of orders |

---

### 4.2 Modeling Strategy

We begin with a **unified model** using lifecycle-aware features.  

- No segment-specific models or classifiers at this stage
- customer_stage and tenure_days allow the model to learn behavioral patterns by customer age

**Why this matters**:
- Keeps operations simple and agile
- Avoids overfitting small segments (e.g., brand new customers)

**Future Path (V3)**: 
If significant feature divergence or RMSE drift by segment is detected, we will evolve to meta-modeling (per-stage models routed via classifier).

---

### 4.3 Automatic Time Window Selection

The engine dynamically selects the best history/prediction window pair: 

- History (lookback): 3 to 18 months
- Prediction (forecast): 3, 6, or 12 months
- Best combination selected by accuracy composite score

---

### 4.4 Adaptive Filtering for Validity

We only train models where:
- At least 100 customers 
- Or >5% of base population for a given time window

Prevents noisy, unrepresentative results.

---

### 4.5 Behavioral Cadence Feature (Order Gap Stats)

For repeat customers ( purchases > 1), we calculate:

- mean_days_between_orders: average purchase cadence
- median_days_between_orders: typical interval between purchases
- std_days_between_orders: consistency or irregularity in purchase behavior

Support churn prediction, re-engagement strategy, and upsell planning.

---

### 4.6 CLV Prioritization and Customer Understanding Strategy

We use a combined strategy of **ranking for prioritization** and **clustering for understanding**.

#### CLV Ranking:
- Predict CLV per customer using regression model
- Rank customers by predicted CLV
- Bin into CLV segments using percentiles (Top 1%, 5%, 10%, etc.)
- Output: `clv_percentile`, `clv_segment`

#### Exploratory Clustering:
- Use behavioral features (tenure, recency, AOV, etc.)
- Group customers using unsupervised clustering (e.g., KMeans)
- Assign `cluster_id` to each customer for insight

#### Strategic Intent for V1:
- **Use clustering for insight, not action**
- Share cluster profiles with marketing/product stakeholders
- Discuss:
  - "Does this cluster describe a known customer group?"
  - "Should we treat this group differently?"
  - "Can we personalize their journey in the future?"

#### Example Output:

| Cluster | CLV Tier | Profile | Suggested Action |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------|
| C1 | Top 10% | Loyal, low AOV | Promote bundles |
| C2 | Top 1% | New, high spend | White-glove onboarding |
| C3 | Mid CLV | Churn-risk | Retarget with reminders |

#### Deliverables:
- `clv_predictions.csv`: includes predicted CLV + rank + cluster
- `cluster_summary.csv`: high-level stats for each segment
- Strategic discussion slides: clustering patterns, personas

---

## 5. Explainability and Lifecycle Insights

We use **SHAP values** to explain:

- Which features drive overall CLV
- What features matter most by lifecycle stage
- Which combinations (interactions) are most predictive
(e.g., tenure_days × recency_days → indicates risk in long-term customers with recent disengagement)


Output:
- SHAP summary PNG
- Top 10 interactions in `interactions.csv`
- Per-segment SHAP metrics

---

## 6. Segment Tracking From Day 1

### Primary: Customer Lifecycle (customer_stage)
Based on tenure since first purchase:

| Stage | Tenure(days) |
|-------|--------------|
| New | 0–90 |
| Growing | 91–180 |
| Established | 181–365 |
| Loyal | >365 |


### Secondary: Status Segment (status_segment)
Based on recency since last purchase:

| Status | Recency(days) |
|--------|---------------|
| Active | <=30 |
| Lagging | 31–90 |
| Dormant | 91–180 |
| Churn-risk | >180 |

Outputs:
- RMSE, MAE, SHAP by `customer_stage` in `segment_metrics.csv`
- Crossed segment logic used for customer actions

---

## 7. Business Segments and Prescriptive Guidance 

Crossing customer_stage and status_segment as lifecycle:

| Segment | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| New + Active | Fast-track onboarding |
| Growing + Lagging | Nurture with relevant content |
| Loyal + Dormant | Personalized winback campaign |
| Repeat + Low AOV | Upsell bundles or premium offer |
| One-timer + High AOV | Incentivize second purchase |

These segments will be output in `business_segments.csv`.

---

## 8. Monitoring and Governance

| What We Track | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| Feature drift | Detect behavior change |
| Prediction drift | CLV output distribution may shift |
| Segment shift | Ensure lifecycle balance |
| SHAP drift | Alert on shifts in model logic |
| Alerts | Trigger retraining if accuracy drops >20% |

All tracked via `model_metadata.json` and reported quarterly.

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement Roadmap

| Phase | Upgrade |
|-------|---------|
| V1 | Unified model + exploratory clustering |
| V2 | Per-segment metrics |
| V3 | Meta-modeling for per-lifecycle models (only if volume justifies) |
| V4 | Profit-based LTV (includes CAC and margins) |
| V5 | Real-time scoring and personalization |
| V6 | CLV-powered A/B tests |

---
