# Launch Readiness Checklist
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Engine — Production MVP Release

---

## 1. Codebase Integrity

- [x] All `src/` modules built, imported, and working correctly.
- [x] All `scripts/` orchestration scripts working without import errors.
- [x] `run_full_pipeline.py` orchestrates full pipeline end-to-end successfully.

---

## 2. Pipeline Execution

- [x] Model training (`scripts/train_model.py`) completes and saves model artifact to `models/`.
- [x] Customer scoring and ranking (`scripts/predict_and_rank_customers.py`) completes and saves predictions.
- [x] Customer clustering (`scripts/cluster_customers.py`) completes and saves clusters.
- [x] Cluster ranking (`scripts/cluster_rank_customers.py`) completes and saves ranked clusters.
- [x] Monitoring check (`scripts/monitoring_check.py`) completes and saves feature drift and prediction drift reports.

---

## 3. Monitoring and Governance

- [x] `outputs/monitoring/` folder created automatically if missing.
- [x] Feature drift reports saved as `feature_drift_report_TIMESTAMP.csv`.
- [x] Prediction drift reports saved as `prediction_drift_report_TIMESTAMP.json`.
- [x] No automatic retraining triggered — manual human review required after drift detected.
- [x] Monitoring thresholds (RMSE and R² drift) configured in `config/model_config.yaml`.

---

## 4. Inputs and Outputs

- [x] `data/raw/transactions.csv` exists and has valid schema (customer_id, order_date, revenue).
- [x] `data/processed/processed_features.csv` created successfully.
- [x] `outputs/clv_ranked_predictions.csv` created after scoring.
- [x] `outputs/clv_clustered_customers.csv` created after clustering.
- [x] `outputs/clv_cluster_rankings.csv` created after cluster ranking.
- [x] `outputs/monitoring/` folder populated after monitoring.

---

## 5. Configuration and Parameters

- [x] `config/model_config.yaml` clean and updated.
- [x] No stale fields (e.g., features_to_cluster removed).
- [x] All modeling, scoring, clustering, monitoring settings controlled by config.
- [x] No hidden hardcoded parameters inside scripts.

---

## 6. Documentation and Handover

- [x] `README.md` updated, aligned with final codebase.
- [x] Project structure diagram updated in README.
- [x] Monitoring and Governance Policy clearly documented.
- [x] Future Enhancements listed in README.

---

## 7. Final Full System Test

- [x] Full pipeline run completed successfully with:

```bash
python run_full_pipeline.py
